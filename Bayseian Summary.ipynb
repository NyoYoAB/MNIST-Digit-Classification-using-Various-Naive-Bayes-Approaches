    "## Key Findings\n",
    "1. Model complexity generally correlated with improved performance\n",
    "2. Gaussian-based models significantly outperformed the traditional Naive Bayes\n",
    "3. KNN showed superior performance, likely due to its ability to capture complex patterns\n",
    "4. All models struggled with visually similar digits (e.g., 4 vs 9, 3 vs 5)\n",
    "5. Balancing model complexity, computational efficiency, and interpretability is crucial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges Faced\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The project demonstrated the evolution of model complexity and performance in digit recognition. While KNN provided the best results, each model offered valuable insights into the trade-offs between simplicity, interpretability, and accuracy. The findings can inform future approaches to similar image classification problems."
